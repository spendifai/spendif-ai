# Transaction Classification Guide

> How Spendif.ai turns your bank transactions into categorised data with minimal manual effort.

---

## 1. Import

Upload your transactions file (CSV, XLSX, XLS) by dragging it into the upload area.

- Spendif.ai recognises the file schema automatically and computes a **confidence score** (0-100%).
- If confidence is >= 80%, import proceeds without user intervention.
- Transactions are categorised by AI (LLM) and any existing deterministic rules.

---

## 2. Review

Transactions where the AI was not confident are flagged for review.

- Uncertain transactions are marked with a **warning** flag (needs review)
- For each one you can correct **category**, **subcategory** and **context** from dropdown menus
- Confirm with **Validated** to tell Spendif.ai "this classification is correct"
- You can also create a rule directly from the Review page, just like in the Ledger

---

## 3. Ledger — The command centre

Full view of all imported transactions, with filters for date, account, category and type.

**Direct editing:** change category, subcategory and context directly in the grid. Each change updates `category_source` to "manual".

**Validation:** tick the Validated checkbox to confirm the category is correct. Saving is immediate and the warning flag is automatically cleared.

**Create a rule from a transaction:**

1. Select **1 row** using the selection column (📏) in the ledger grid. If you select more than one row, the app shows a red error: *"You can only create and apply one rule at a time"*.
2. A **"Create rule"** form appears, pre-filled with:
   - **Pattern**: extracted from the transaction's counterpart (e.g. `ESSELUNGA`)
   - **Type**: *Contains text* (default). Available options: *Contains text*, *Exact match*, *Advanced expression*
   - **Category/Subcategory/Context**: copied from the selected transaction
3. A **preview** shows how many transactions will be matched by the rule
4. If the rule already exists, a yellow warning appears and the button changes to **"Edit rule and apply"**
5. Click **"Create rule and apply"** (or **"Edit rule and apply"**):
   - The rule is saved to the database
   - It is applied **retroactively** to all matching transactions that have not been validated yet
   - A toast confirms "Rule created" or "Rule updated"

---

## 4. Automatic rules

Rules created (from the Ledger, Review or Rules page) are automatically applied to future imports.

- **Priority**: more specific rules have higher priority. First match wins.
- **Match types**: *Exact match*, *Contains text*, *Advanced expression* (shown in the "Type" column of the rules grid).
- **Rules page**: manage, edit, delete existing rules. Use the "Run all rules" button to apply them in bulk to your entire history.

## 5. The virtuous cycle

```
Import --> AI categorises --> User reviews --> Create rule --> Next import: 0 interventions
```

The more you use Spendif.ai, the less manual work. Every rule you create reduces the number of transactions to review on the next import. Goal: **zero pain**.

## 5b. Auto-learning from history

In addition to rules, Spendif.ai automatically learns from your validations. Every time you validate a transaction (checkbox), the system records the association between the counterpart and the category.

### How it works

1. **Association table** — Spendif.ai groups all validated transactions by description + category + subcategory and counts occurrences.
2. **Homogeneity** — For each counterpart, it calculates how "stable" the classification is (from 0 to 1). If ESSELUNGA is *always* Food, homogeneity = 1.00. If AMAZON is spread across Technology, Food, Clothing, homogeneity is low.
3. **Automatic decision** — On the next import, before calling the AI, Spendif.ai checks history:
   - **Confidence >= 0.90** — assigns directly (source: History), no review needed
   - **Confidence 0.50–0.89** — suggests the category (source: History), but flags it for review
   - **Confidence < 0.50** — calls the AI as usual

### In practice

```
You validate 12 ESSELUNGA transactions as Food
  -> Next import with ESSELUNGA: classified automatically, zero interventions

You validate 8 ROSSOPOMODORO as Dining + 2 as Holidays
  -> Next import: suggests Dining, but puts it in review

AMAZON with 5 different categories
  -> Next import: calls the AI (too heterogeneous for history)
```

> **Important:** only **validated** transactions count for history. Unvalidated transactions have uncertain classifications and are not used for auto-learning.

## Indicator columns

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Warning | Needs review (uncertain classification) |
| Validated | Validated by the user |
| Internal transfer | Internal transfer (transfer between own accounts) |

## Validation vs. classification source

Spendif.ai tracks two **distinct** pieces of information for each transaction:

| Concept | Field | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Validation** | `human_validated` | "I have seen this expense and confirm it is correct (not anomalous)." It is the approval of the **expense**, not the category. |
| **Classification source** | `category_source` | "Who assigned the latest category." Values: AI, Rule, Manual, History. |
| **Classification model** | `category_model` | "Which specific LLM model categorized this." E.g. `gemma-2-2b-it-Q4_K_M`. Empty when source = Rule or Manual. |

**Key rule:** the two fields are independent. When a rule or the AI reclassifies a transaction, the source changes but the validation **is not touched**. Only an explicit click on the "Validated" checkbox (unchecking it) can remove the validation.

**In practice:**
- You validate a transaction classified by AI as "Food" -> `validated=True`, `source=AI`
- Then you create a rule that reclassifies it as "Supermarket" -> `validated=True` (unchanged), `source=Rule`
- The validation stays because you had already confirmed the expense was correct

## Classification source badges

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| AI | Categorised by artificial intelligence |
| Rule | Categorised by deterministic rule |
| Manual | Manually modified by the user |
| History | Categorised from validated history (auto-learning) |
