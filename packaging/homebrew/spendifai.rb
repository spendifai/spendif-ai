# spendifai.rb — Homebrew Cask for Spendif.ai
#
# IMPORTANT: This file lives in the separate tap repository
#   https://github.com/drake69/homebrew-spendifai
# under the path:  Casks/spendifai.rb
#
# It is NOT part of the main code repository (drake69/spendif-ai).
# The release pipeline (packaging/release.sh in the main repo) updates
# the `version` and `sha256` fields automatically on each release and
# commits the change to the tap repo.
#
# User installation:
#   brew tap drake69/spendifai
#   brew install --cask spendifai
#
# To submit to Homebrew Core (requires ≥75 stars, signed+notarised app,
# stable release history): see docs/release_process.md in the main repo.
